# Whiskey

Whiskey is the only Whatsapp History Interpreter and Syntax Komposer Especially
for You.

The origin of the name is a Whatsapp conversation, but the interesting part
here is that it reads a history file (which you can get by emailing yourself a
conversation from within Whatsapp) and outputs a nicely formatted JSON file. It
also anonymizes the information. There's even a nice HTML displayer included.
